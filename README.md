**VULSCANNER ** Our team noticed a recurring pattern in the workplace - outdated, dangerous, and easily breach-able packages were being installed willy-nilly without any care for the damage they could do. Oftentimes, these packages weren't created with malicious intent. Overtime, security issues appear in many older versions of all our favorite packages, and being able to quickly identify and avoid these dangers is incredibly important for developers. That's where VULSCANNER comes in!

VULSCANNER only requests two things - a package name and the environment that package is being used on. Voil√†! That package's past and present security issues will be displayed to you in a table alongside a pie chart displaying the severity of these issues. VULSCANNER also provides the user with AI-generated suggestions of similar packages that could be used to replace anything dangerous.

We built VULSCANNER as a fast, user-friendly application that helps developers strengthen their applications security.
